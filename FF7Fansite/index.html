<h2>What is <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>/</h2>

<p><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> (FFVII or FF7) is a game released by Square Enix, a Japanese entertainment company known for its <em>Final Fantasy</em> series. Square Enix released FF7 for the PlayStation 1 on January 31, 1997, becoming one of the most loved and well-known Japanese Role-Playing Games (JRPGs).</p>

<p>The love for FF7 is due to how advanced it was for its time, and you can see the upgrades FF7 had when comparing it to <em>Final Fantasy 6</em>. Also, players love FF7 for the storyline, characters, world-building, graphics, and cutscenes. On top of this, FF7 gamers love the Original Sound Tracks (OSTs), and that is thanks to FF7's composer Nobuo Uematsu. Thanks to Uematsu, gamers can instantly recognize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVm1HOSQgoc&list=OLAK5uy_mvDV7aOFHvvOJRUGGoyxNBDIVb49Mbu1k" target="blank">Prelude</a>, the iconic villain theme <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzQE_7mn8ts" target="_blank">One-Winged Angel</a>, and the tearjerker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0H6kTppjP8" target="_blank">Aerith's Theme</a>.</p>

<p>The only downside of FF7 is if you wanted to play it on the PlayStation 1, you would have needed to switch between three discs to play the full game. The reason is all of the cutscenes took a lot of space in one disc, so Square Enix had to divide the cutscenes into three discs to make the game playable.</p>

<p>Moving on, due to the immense love the game received, Square Enix decided to make a franchise out of FF7, installing games, an original video animations (OVAs), and a movie throughout the 2000s. Also, Square Enix dropped hints of remastering FF7, but disappointed fans until Square Enix released on April 10, 2020, <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>.</p>

<p>Knowing this, fans can say that Square Enix has its hands full with the FF7 franchise due to the plans they have and the theories fans have come up with, which I will later add.</p>

<h2>What the Official Compilation Includes</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, Square Enix installed games, OVAs and a movie into the FF7 franchise during the 2000s, but the company decided to take out some of the content. This is why the heading says "Official Compilation" since I will tell you what is important for the full storyline of FF7. Saying this, it may seem like a lot at first glance, but it is not. Here is the list, in order of the release date for Japan, of everything that is relevant in the FF7 franchise:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> - January 31, 1997</li>
	<li><em>Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII</em> - September 24, 2004</li>
	<li><em>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</em> - September 14, 2005</li>
	<li><em>Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII</em> - January 6, 2006</li>
	<li><em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</em> - September 13, 2007</li>
	<li><em>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete</em> - April 16, 2009</li>
	<li><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> - April 10, 2020</li>
	<li><em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion</em> - December 13, 2022</li>
	<li><em>Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis</em> - 2022 TBA</li>
	<li><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> - Late 2023 - Early 2024 TBA</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the most important games and movie in the FF7 franchise. Playing the games, or even watching the gameplays on YouTube, and watching the movie will make you understand the full lore of FF7. With that said, there are books and minigames in the franchise. Some of the minigames are no longer playable or were never released outside of Japan, but it is nothing to worry about as it has very little relevance to the FF7 lore. Also, the books will help you understand more of the lore or even understand some of the characters' perspective. If you want to, you can find everything released under the FF7 franchise <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Compilation_of_Final_Fantasy_VII" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>The Order</h2>

<p>You might be wondering the order you should play the games and watch the movie to understand the full FF7 lore and to not get any spoilers. When I say this, it means the games and movie have lots of references to each other, so if you play the series or watch the movie out of order, you most likely ruined the fun for yourself. Do not fear, here is a list to play the games and watch the movie in order:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></li>
	<li><em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</em></li>
	<li><em>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete</em></li>
	<li><em>Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII</em></li>
</ul>

<p>As you see, the list is short compared to the one above. The reason is these games and movie hold the core of the lore. Playing and watching the FF7 series in this order will get you ready to play anything after <em>Remake</em>. Also, anything starting from <em>Remake</em> is playable in the order listed under "What the Official Compilation Includes."</p>

<p>You have probably noticed I have yet to mention <em>Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII</em>. The reason is since this game is no longer playable, you can only watch the gameplay on YouTube. Technically, you can watch the gameplay anytime after you have finished playing the the original FF7 since you might get spoilers on what will happen in FF7. Also, there are rumors saying that <em>Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis</em> will include <em>Before Crisis</em>'s storyline, but Square Enix has yet to tell fans more news about <em>Ever Crisis</em> since it is in its beta testing.</p>

<p>Quick thing I want to mention. You have noticed that there is <em>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete</em>. They are both films for the series, except, as the title says, <em>Advent Children Complete</em> is the full movie. When <em>Advent Children</em> came out, fans did not appreciate it too much since they believed the main protagonist started developing backwards. Also, the fans said the movie felt incomplete. Well, they were not wrong since Square Enix admitted to cutting some scenes out of the film. Square Enix promised the fans to release the complete version in 2008, but it got delayed to 2009. After seeing the complete version, fans felt more at ease since it went good with the FF7 lore.</p>

<h2>Now at the End</h2>

<p>Earlier under "What is <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>?" I said that fans know that Square Enix has its hands full with the FF7 franchise, and that is due to Square Enix remastering the series. They have yet to state whether they will remaster all of the games in the series and the movie. Slowly, fans are speculating that it will be the case since <em>Crisis Core</em> has been remastered, and many people thought it was not going to be possible since Square Enix is busy with other <em>Final Fantasy</em> games and with the remastering of FF7. Only time will tell what Sqaure Enix will do with the series, but fans are hoping the whole series will get remastered.</p>
