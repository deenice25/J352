            <p>While Division 1 universities have come under fire from students and faculty for overfunding athletic programs to attract recruits and not injecting money into other beneficial areas at the university,  the University of College Park (UCP) has just decided to do the opposite for certain athletic programs.</p>

<p>UCP President Jordan Masters announced on Wednesday that the university will be cutting funding to seven athletic programs effective immediately. However, these programs all have one similar trait – all seven of the programs are only men’s sports.</p>

<p>The teams that will be receiving budget cuts are the football team, men’s basketball team, men’s soccer team, men’s lacrosse team, men’s hockey team, wrestling team and lastly the men’s tennis team. The University of College Park has not provided any reasoning behind the similarities in the cuts, just calling them necessary in order to provide the student body a better quality of life on and off campus.</p> 

<p>Even though the new budget has not been released, President Masters has announced that each of the programs will be receiving a 30% decrease in their budgets for the next season. Even though the football program receives 500% more funding than the men’s tennis program, both of their budgets will be axed by 30%.</p> 

<p>The effects of the budget cuts are already being noticed, with the UCP football team announcing that it is letting go of two equipment managers and a few members of the media staff in response. Gordon Jefferies, one of the fired equipment managers who had been with the team for 18 years, responded to his firing on Twitter. His post thanked the program and understood, but pleaded for some clarification from the higher ups at the university.</p>

<p>“Usually this type of a move is done in response to a lack of team success, but it seems like I was just fired because of a resentment towards the prosperity of these talented young men,” Jefferies said.</p>

<p>Lisa Brokowski, the Director of Communications for the Department of Athletics, said that she was at a loss for words when having to fire 20 employees due to the budget cuts.</p>

<p>“These men and women worked extremely hard at this school, and having to relieve them of their duties just because they work with men, it was definitely a first for me,” she detailed.</p>

<p>President Masters explained that the money would specifically be going towards the school’s on-campus residents, dining services, as well as on- and off-campus transportation services. Certain academic departments will also be receiving a boost in funding, oddly the UCP Department of Gender Studies getting the biggest boost in budget.</p>

<p>Jordan Morris, a sophomore student living on campus, was originally overjoyed by the improvements, but was interested what effects the move would have on student support of athletics.</p>

<p>“We’re gonna have better food in dining halls, and definitely a lot more people showing up to women’s basketball games,” Morris chimed.</p>

<p>The programs that were affected have experienced varied success over the years. The men’s soccer team being the biggest achievers, winning the conference championship each of the last four years. Sophomore attacker Dylan Gorski is now left wondering if the program can continue having success in the future.</p> 

<p>“As we move into the future, other school’s will get improved athletic facilities and NIL deals,” Gorski said. “Prospective athletes could start to favor schools that give them more resources and not focus as much on winning and success.”</p>

<p>UCP has never been viewed as a “sports school”; it isn’t even a Power Five program. But athletic director Colin Mansfield believes that this could definitely lead to a massive loss in admissions and revenue in the future.</p>

<p>“While college should be about academics, sports bring student bodies together despite their differences to support a common good,” he said. “With a lack of success in sports that bring in a lot of revenue, we will definitely see students choose Duke over UCP for reasons other than academic prowess.”
